- Given I set of input clauses. Query or goal clause.

- Ai agent whose axiom set is I.

- Pa = <LitA> stable production field. LitA set of all literals in the language of A.

- Consequence finding in Ai

- N = Carc(Ai, Pa)



- While new characteristics clauses are derived

  - For each clause C in N, 

    - decide an agent Aj to which C is sent from Ai		Message de C de Ai à Aj

    - Consequence finding in Ai with top clause C by SOL.	

    - N = NewCarc(Ai, C, Pa)

    - Ai = mu(Ai union N)
