0.3.11
	correction de bug sur ComputeExtendedHyp (did not use inverse entailment field).
0.3.12
	correction de bugs (manif were not added to narrowed field
						need to unblock avec withdraw-incomplete)
0.3.13
	correction de bugs:
		refonte du calcul de contexte et extHyp par language, car la sŽparation compromettait la
			soundness
		Debuggage de cette refonte, en assurant notamment que l'adaptation du langage au graphe soit
			bien prise en compte.
0.3.135
	correction bug correspondance entre computeCtx() et computeCtx(hyp,prev, tt,pf)
	(dans DiagAgentUsingCommLan.computeCtx(...))
0.3.136
	correction bug mise ˆ jour sur adoption d'une hypotheses complete apres une hypothese partielle
	(mise a jour de partialHyp dans LocalTheory.setFavHypothesis 
	et ajout de if (updatedCand) dans LocalTheory.unblockAllHyp())
	suppression de updatedCtx=False dans unblock (as the hypothesis
		 might stays the same, leaving the context valid)
	 error on willProposeEmpty at start.
	 error on computeFavExtHyp : semi-partial hypotheses were not considered (added PField to it)
0.3.137
	partial hyp field : need to include mixed partial hyp (to solve subgoals even when not sufficient)
		uses partlyBelongsTo instead of belongsTo when pruning partial hyp
	need to add new clauses to extHypField	to have all candidates from argue in computeExtHyp
0.3.138
	change addTheory to deal with Inform that cause partial Hyp not to be relevant for testing 
		(for ex if the only literal of that hyp that is in the commLanguage is confirmed to be true)
	ensure partial hyp with non blocked abd are proposed even if partial 
		(as hypfield removed from pruning) -> finally cancelled
			-> replaced by requiring one agent to declare all hypothesis field in its initial language
	ensure partial hyp whose literals in comm. language are all blocked are pruned out
0.3.139
	limit refutation to subhyp concerned
	put off the 'Exlcusive' characteristic of the solver
0.3.1395
	correction of limit refutation : keep hyp and not top clauses
	NOTE on language : 
		- one agent should have all hyp field in its individual language 
			(to ensure different part of a common solution have a path to rejoin)
		- observations should have slightly higher weight than the other non-abductible
			it ensures that when an agent settle on a partial hyp, it stays 
				the same regardless of its neighbour
