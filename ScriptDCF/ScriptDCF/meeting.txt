portfolio-based search strategy
	-> analyze problems : How ?
=> E have some criteria
	ML algorithm on training set

general case:
if CF rather than refut ?
	need for exahustive search

Future work
   - extention to CF in general case
   - parallel processing
   - efficient composition algo for substitutions


Query answering problem : libraries ?

new asynchronous and complete solver for Dis-SAT
- Based on Asynchronous Backtracking Algorithm
- each agents has a complex theorie (and not just one variable as usually)
- local computation can use any SAT solver


latest
DPLL ABT Ruiz, Alreview 2010, one variable by agent

method : complete, asynchronous, partioned by clause, with complex local problem for each agents.

asynchronous
	- every agent works asynchronously and in parallel
	- THE SYSTEM EVENTUALLY IDENTIFIES SAT/UNSAT

Assumption
- a priority is introduced among agents (arbitrarily)

(HR : + implicit priority between variable of
